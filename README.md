Developer with a passion for Bitcoin, FOSS, and AI/ML.

# My mission:
To create in software that is meaningful for individuals.
To be surounded by colleagues and teams building impactful software.

# My history:
I began my journey self taught after my interest in Bitcoin grew to a passion along with my understanding of money and software. Quickly my pursuit outgrew my means, and I got serious enough about my interest 3 years ago to enter Lambda School (now Bloomtech) as a Full Stack Web student. While continuing my studies, I worked as a Team Lead for 1 year helping other students learn to code. After graduation, in 2021, I accepted a position at Forethought as an AI Solutions Engineer.
