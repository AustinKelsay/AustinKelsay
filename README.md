Software engineer with a passion for Bitcoin, FOSS, and AI/ML.

# My mission:
To participate in software that is meaningful for individuals.
To be surounded by colleagues and teams building impactful software.

# My history:
I began my journey as a self taught developer with a passion for Bitcoin/FOSS. However, I learn faster in a team environment, so I got serious 2 years ago & enrolled in Lambda School as a Full Stack Web student. From Lambda School I graduated as a student and worked as a Team Lead for 1 year helping teach students how to code. Since mid 2021 I have worked as an AI Implementation Engineer at Forethought
